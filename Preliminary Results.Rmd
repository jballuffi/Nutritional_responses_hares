## Preliminary results

Figures and preliminary results for chapter 4.

![Figure 2. Linear relationship between hare overwinter weight loss in response to hare weight in the previous autumn on an individual basis. Weight loss is the difference between body weight in autumn (average from September -- November) and spring (average from March and April). Line uses data from 1977 -- 2022.](Output/Figures/hodges_figure.jpeg "Figure 2.")

![Figure 3. Means by winter for A) daily mean temperature (C), B) daily hare density (hares/hectare), C) monthly mortality rate, D) daily snow depth (cm), E) daily willow twig availability (kg/hectare), and F) daily per capita willow twig availability (kg/hare). Data includes all values collected in January through March for each winter.](Output/Figures/env_summary_figure1.jpeg)

![Figure 4. Mean A) overwinter weight change residuals (g), B) fecal protein content (%), C) and daily foraging effort (hours/day) by winter. Boxes are colored according to food supplementation treatment (red = food add, grey = control).](Output/Figures/dep_var_figure.jpeg)
