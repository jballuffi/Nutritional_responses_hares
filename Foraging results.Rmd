Averaged by week, snowshoe hare foraging rate was very flexible (`r forag[, round(median(forage), 1)]` ± `r forag[, round(sd(forage), 1)]`), ranging from a minimum of `r forag[, round(min(forage), 1)]` to `r forag[, round(max(forage), 1)]` hours per day (Figure 2A). Food supplementation reduced foraging effort by `r round(foragfood[food == 0, mean(forage)] - foragfood[food == 1, mean(forage)], 1)` hours (p = `r pfood`, t = `r tfood`, df = `r dffood`; Figure 2A). As day length increased from January to March, hares decreased their foraging rate by `r nightcoef` ± `r nightse` minutes per hour decrease in night length (p = `r pnight`, t = `r tnight`, df = `r dfnight`).

The most parsimonious model for explaining foraging effort by control hares (delta AIC < 2) was that which included twig biomass and temperature as fixed effects (Table 1, model D2). This model found that hares foraged `r sb_coef*10*60` ± `r sb_se*10*60` minutes more per day for every 10 kg per hectare increase in available twig biomass (t = `r sb_t`). This meant that as twig biomass increased from `r sb_pred[, min(x)]` to `r sb_pred[, max(x)]` kg/ha, hares foraging effort increased from `r sb_pred[x == min(x), round(predicted, 1)]` to `r sb_pred[x == max(x), round(predicted, 1)]` hr/day (Figure 3A). Additionally, the same model showed that for every 10 degree C increase in ambient temperature, hares foraged `r t_coef*10*60` ± `r t_se*10*60` minutes more per day (t = `r t_t`). Meaning that as weekly temperatures increased from the coldest of `r t_pred[, min(x)]` to the warmest of `r t_pred[, max(x)]`, hare foraging rate increased from `r t_pred[x == min(x), round(predicted, 1)]` to `r t_pred[x == max(x), round(predicted, 1)]` hours per day (Figure 3B).

After testing this model (D2) on the food treatment data set, we found no effect of available twig biomass overall (t = `r foodsb_t`), but there was a interaction between food treatment and twig bioamss on foraging rates (t = `r intsb_t`. When twigs were least available (`r foodb_pred[, min(x)]` kg/ha), foraging rates were similar between control and food supplemented individuals, but when twigs were most available (`r foodb_pred[, max(x)]` kg/ha), controls foraged `r round(foodb_pred[food == 0 & x == max(x), predicted] - foodb_pred[food == 1 & x == max(x), predicted], 2)` hours more than food supplemented individuals (Figure 3C). Similar to the control model, this model showed foraging effort increased with warmer temperatures (B = `r foodt_coef*10*60` ± `r foodt_se*10*60`; t = `r foodt_t`). There was also a significant interaction between food treatment and temperature (t = `r intt_t`)l; control and food supplemented hares foraged for similar lengths of time at the coldest temperatures, but during the warmest weeks, as both groups foraged more, control hares foraged `r round(foodt_pred[x == max(x) & food == 0, predicted] - foodt_pred[x == max(x) & food == 1, predicted], 1)` hours more per day than food supplemented hares (Figure 3D).
