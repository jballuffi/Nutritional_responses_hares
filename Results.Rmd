##General results

Median hare densities during our study period were `r dat[, round(median(haredensity), 2)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha, reaching a maximum of `r dat[, round(max(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha in `r dat[haredensity == max(haredensity), year]` and a minimum of `r dat[, round(min(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha in `r dat[haredensity == min(haredensity), year]` (Figure 1A). Hares experienced, on average, `r dat[, round(median(mortrate), 2)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(mortrate), 1)]`% chance of being predated per month (`r dat[, min(mortrate)]` - `r dat[mortrate == max(mortrate), mean(year)]`%; Figure 1B). The median ambient temperature was `r dat[, round(median(temp), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(temp), 1)]` C (Figure 1C). Temperature varied week to week within each winter (`r dat[, round(min(temp), 1)]` - `r dat[, round(max(temp), 1)]` C). Weekly snow depths were `r dat[, round(median(snow), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(snow), 1)]` cm on average (`r dat[, round(min(snow), 1)]` - `r dat[, round(max(snow), 1)]`). The pattern of snow accumulation differed between winters: some experienced gradual increases (e.g., 2018 and 2019), while others had heavy and sudden snow falls that dramatic increased the snow depth (e.g., 2017 and 2020). Additionally, in 2016 and 2019, which were warmer on average, snow began to melt in march. This caused a lot of variation in willow twig availability within and between winters. Generally, willow availability declined over winter. We estimated there to be a median of `r dat[, round(median(biomass), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(biomass), 1)]` kg per hectare of soluble willow twigs available to hares (`r dat[, round(min(biomass), 1)]` - `r dat[, round(max(biomass), 1)]`; Figure 1D).
