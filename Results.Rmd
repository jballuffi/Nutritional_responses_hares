##General results

Average hare densities during our study period were `r dat[, round(mean(haredensity), 2)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha, reaching a maximum of `r dat[, round(max(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha in `r dat[haredensity == max(haredensity), year]` and a minimum of `r dat[, round(min(haredensity), 2)]` hares/ha in `r dat[haredensity == min(haredensity), year]` (Figure 1A). Hares experienced, on average, a `r dat[, round(mean(mortrate), 2)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(mortrate), 1)]`% chance of being predated per month. Monthly mortality rates ranged from `r dat[, min(mortrate)]` to `r dat[, max(mortrate)]`% (Figure 1B). Temperatures varied week to week within each winter, ranging from `r dat[, round(min(temp), 1)]` to `r dat[, round(max(temp), 1)]` °C (`r dat[, round(mean(temp), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(temp), 1)]` °C; Figure 1C). Weekly snow depths beginning in January started at `r dat[, round(min(snow), 1)]` cm and reach up to `r dat[, round(max(snow), 1)]` cm (`r dat[, round(mean(snow), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(snow), 1)]` cm). The pattern of snow accumulation differed between winters: some experienced gradual increases (e.g., 2018 and 2019), while others had heavy and sudden snow falls that dramatic increased the snow depth (e.g., 2017 and 2020). Additionally, in 2016 and 2019, which were warmer on average, snow began to melt in March. The lowest soluble biomass of willow found was `r dat[, round(min(biomass), 1)]` kg/hectare, and the highest was `r dat[, round(max(biomass), 1)]` kg/hectare (`r dat[, round(mean(biomass), 1)]` ± `r dat[, round(sd(biomass), 1)]` kg/hectare). Generally, willow availability declined over winter (Figure 1D).
